# The harness library, passed to every harness as `zoo`.
#
# A harness describes how to launch one instance of its target and hands
# that to a runner:
#
#   zoo.sandboxed  the campaign runs as a Nix build (sandboxed.nix)
#   zoo.host       the campaign runs on your machine (host.nix)
#
# `launch <run dir>` starts one target process. It writes the target's stderr
# to <run dir>/stderr/<pid> and to the terminal, which zoo.teeStderr does, so
# the spec sees crash messages. zoo.launchInCopy builds such a script for
# targets that work on a copy of some seed state. Either runner gives the
# harness fuzz-<name> and reproduce-<name> apps that write results to
# .state/<name>/.
