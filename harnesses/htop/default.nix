  # Runs as PID 1 of the namespace: starts a few processes for htop to
  # list, sort, tag, renice and show as a tree, then becomes htop. Their
  # names are valid UTF-8 with wide, combining and emoji characters, so
  # the process table has to cut them at column boundaries, but nothing
  # in them is invalid or unprintable, which htop would show as U+FFFD
  # on purpose.
  #
  # Each is a bash that waits on a sleep, since bash doesn't care what
  # its argv[0] is and coreutils, a single binary, picks the program by
  # it. The "; :" keeps bash from replacing itself with the sleep. A
  # command name (comm) comes from the file name, which the kernel cuts
  # at 15 bytes, so the symlinks' names are 15 bytes or less and end on a
  # character boundary.
